        <h1>My Registrations</h1>
        <p>All of your COAR registrations are listed here, separated into Active and Expired tabbed sections. These data
            tables are dynamic and can be sorted by their header columns. Each row is a summary of the most pertinent
            information, which can be expanded to show the entire registration record via the expand icon-link in the
            last cell of each row. Click the Consumer Key or Secret links for a popup that will allow you to copy the full key.</p>
